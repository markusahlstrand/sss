# .NET Orders Service Implementation

This implementation demonstrates a **Service Standard v1** compliant microservice built with **ASP.NET Core 8.0**.

## Architecture Overview

### Framework Choice: ASP.NET Core

ASP.NET Core was selected for its:

- **Native OpenAPI support** via Swashbuckle
- **Excellent JWT/OAuth2 integration**
- **Built-in dependency injection**
- **Comprehensive middleware pipeline**
- **Strong type safety** with C# records
- **Performance** and scalability
- **Rich ecosystem** for observability

### Key Implementation Decisions

#### 1. Project Structure

- **Domain-driven organization** with separate folders for Orders, Auth, Events, etc.
- **Clean separation** of concerns between controllers, services, and models
- **Middleware-based** cross-cutting concerns (auth, logging, error handling)

#### 2. Authentication & Authorization

- **JWT Bearer tokens** with `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication.JwtBearer`
- **Scope-based authorization** using ASP.NET Core policies
- **Custom token generator** for development/testing
- **Stateless authentication** following OAuth2 best practices

#### 3. API Design

- **Controller-based** REST API with attribute routing
- **Record types** for immutable DTOs and models
- **Model validation** using Data Annotations
- **OpenAPI generation** via Swashbuckle with security schemes

#### 4. Error Handling

- **Global exception middleware** for consistent error responses
- **Custom exception types** mapped to HTTP status codes
- **RFC 7807 Problem Details** for all error responses
- **Structured error logging** with correlation IDs

#### 5. Events & Observability

- **CloudEvents library** for standardized event publishing
- **Serilog** for structured JSON logging
- **OpenTelemetry** for distributed tracing
- **Health checks** with ASP.NET Core health check middleware
- **Automatic trace context** propagation

#### 6. Data Management

- **In-memory storage** for simplicity (easily replaceable with EF Core)
- **Repository pattern** abstraction with interface-based design
- **Async/await** throughout for scalability

## Service Standard v1 Compliance

### ✅ API (REST via OpenAPI)

- OpenAPI 3.0 specification generated from code
- JSON-only content type
- Resource-oriented paths (`/orders/{id}`)
- Pagination with `limit` and `offset`
- Comprehensive request/response schemas

### ✅ Authentication

- OAuth2 bearer token support
- Scope-based authorization (`orders.read`, `orders.write`)
- JWT token validation with configurable secrets
- Service information and health endpoints are public

### ✅ Events

- CloudEvents JSON format
- AsyncAPI specification
- Event publishing on order lifecycle changes
- Structured event payloads with JSON Schema validation

### ✅ Logging & Observability

- Structured JSON logging with required fields:
  - `timestamp` (ISO 8601)
  - `level` (INFO, WARN, ERROR)
  - `service` ("orders")
  - `trace_id` and `span_id`
  - `message`
- OpenTelemetry tracing with W3C Trace Context
- Jaeger exporter for trace visualization

### ✅ Health & Lifecycle

- `/healthz` liveness probe
- `/readyz` readiness probe
- Environment variable configuration only
- Stateless design (no local persistence)
- Graceful shutdown support

### ✅ Service Manifest

- Complete `service.yaml` with all required fields
- OpenAPI and AsyncAPI specifications
- Required scopes documentation

## .NET-Specific Benefits

### Strong Type Safety

- **Compile-time validation** of API contracts
- **Record types** for immutable data models
- **Nullable reference types** prevent null pointer exceptions
- **Pattern matching** for clean error handling

### Performance

- **Minimal API overhead** with attribute routing
- **Async I/O** throughout the pipeline
- **Memory-efficient** logging with structured formats
- **Native JSON serialization** with System.Text.Json

### Developer Experience

- **IntelliSense** and code completion
- **Integrated debugging** with Visual Studio/VS Code
- **NuGet package management**
- **Hot reload** during development
- **Swagger UI** for interactive API testing

### Production Readiness

- **Built-in health checks**
- **Metrics collection** with OpenTelemetry
- **Configuration providers** for various sources
- **Docker support** with multi-stage builds
- **Cloud-native** deployment options

## Testing Strategy

### Development Testing

- **JWT token generation** for local testing
- **Examples script** demonstrating all endpoints
- **Swagger UI** for interactive exploration
- **Health check verification**

### Integration Points

- **Authentication flow** with JWT validation
- **Error handling** across different scenarios
- **Event publishing** with CloudEvents format
- **OpenAPI specification** accuracy

## Deployment Considerations

### Container Strategy

- **Multi-stage Dockerfile** for optimized images
- **Non-root execution** for security
- **Health check integration** with container orchestrators
- **Environment variable injection**

### Observability

- **Jaeger tracing** for distributed debugging
- **Structured logging** for centralized log aggregation
- **Health endpoints** for load balancer integration
- **Metrics exposure** for monitoring systems

## Comparison with Other Implementations

### vs. Node.js/NestJS

- **Stronger type safety** at compile time
- **Better performance** for CPU-intensive tasks
- **More mature** enterprise ecosystem
- **Simpler deployment** with single binary

### vs. Python/FastAPI

- **Faster execution** and lower memory usage
- **Compile-time validation** vs runtime validation
- **Better tooling** for large codebases
- **More complex** setup for simple services

### vs. Rust/Axum

- **Easier development** and maintenance
- **Richer ecosystem** for enterprise features
- **Higher memory usage** but still efficient
- **Less performance** but more developer productivity

This implementation showcases .NET's strengths in building robust, maintainable microservices while fully adhering to Service Standard v1 requirements.
