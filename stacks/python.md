âœ… Flexible, good for ML/data-heavy services, or quick iterations.

- FastAPI

  - First-class OpenAPI support (built-in).

  - Simple OAuth2 integration.

  - Async support for event-driven apps.

  - Works well with Pydantic (strict JSON Schema validation).

  - Logging & OpenTelemetry well supported.

- Django REST Framework

  - More heavyweight, great for CRUD-heavy apps.

  - Better suited if you also need ORM + admin panel.
