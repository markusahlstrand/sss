## Common Dependencies

All router options share some common Node.js dependencies for Service Standard v1 compliance:

### Authentication

```json
{
  "jsonwebtoken": "^9.0.2"
}
```

### Observability

```json
{
  "@opentelemetry/api": "^1.6.0",
  "@opentelemetry/auto-instrumentations-node": "^0.39.4",
  "@opentelemetry/sdk-node": "^0.43.0"
}
```

### Events

```json
{
  "cloudevents": "^6.0.4"
}
```

## Implementation Requirements

Regardless of router choice, all implementations must include:

### 1. Required Endpoints

- `GET /` - Service info (`{"name": "service-name", "version": "1.0.0"}`)
- `GET /openapi.json` - OpenAPI specification
- `GET /healthz` - Liveness probe
- `GET /readyz` - Readiness probe

### 2. Authentication & Authorization

- Bearer token validation with JWT
- Scope-based authorization
- Proper error responses (401/403)

### 3. Error Handling

- RFC 7807 Problem+JSON format
- Required error types: `validation_error`, `unauthorized`, `forbidden`, `not_found`, `conflict`, `internal_error`
- Detailed validation error messages

### 4. Request/Response Format

- Content-Type: `application/json` only
- JSON Schema validation for all endpoints
- Pagination with `limit` + `offset` parameters

### 5. Events

- CloudEvents v1.0 JSON format
- AsyncAPI 2.0+ specification
- Structured event publishing

### 6. Observability

- Structured JSON logs with: `timestamp`, `level`, `service`, `trace_id`, `span_id`, `message`
- OpenTelemetry integration with W3C Trace Context
- Correlation between requests and logs

## Choosing the Right Router

### Choose **NestJS** if:

- Building enterprise applications with complex business logic
- Working with large teams that need consistent patterns
- Need comprehensive tooling and ecosystem support
- Familiar with Angular or similar decorator-based frameworks
- Prefer strongly opinionated architecture

### Choose **Fastify** if:

- Performance is a critical requirement (high traffic, low latency)
- Building microservices with resource constraints
- Need JSON Schema validation with minimal overhead
- Want plugin-based architecture for modularity
- Comfortable with less opinionated frameworks

### Choose **Hono + Zod** if:

- Deploying to edge computing platforms (Cloudflare Workers, Vercel Edge)
- Building serverless functions with strict cold start requirements
- Want maximum type safety with compile-time schema validation
- Prefer modern Web Standards APIs over Node.js-specific patterns
- Need minimal bundle size for edge/serverless environments

## Recent Implementation Experience

### Hono + Zod OpenAPI Success (August 2025) âœ…

The Hono + Zod OpenAPI implementation was successfully generated and is fully operational:

**Key Strengths:**

- **Excellent type safety**: Full TypeScript inference from Zod schemas to API handlers
- **Automatic OpenAPI generation**: Schemas directly generate accurate API documentation
- **Edge-ready performance**: Ultra-fast with minimal bundle size for serverless deployment
- **Modern development experience**: Schema-first development with excellent tooling
- **Service Standard v1 compliance**: All requirements met with clean, maintainable code

**Technical Highlights:**

- **Version compatibility**: Hono v4 required for latest `@hono/node-server` compatibility
- **JWT integration**: Built-in `jwt()` middleware from Hono core (no separate `@hono/jwt` package needed)
- **Schema-driven**: Zod schemas provide both validation and automatic OpenAPI generation
- **Error handling**: Clean RFC 7807 implementation with centralized error middleware
- **CloudEvents**: Simple integration with structured event publishing

**Development Experience:**

- **Fast build times**: TypeScript compilation and hot reload are very fast
- **Excellent IDE support**: Full IntelliSense and type checking throughout
- **Easy testing**: Built-in test client and comprehensive examples script
- **Clear documentation**: Auto-generated OpenAPI docs are accurate and complete

**Performance Characteristics:**

- **Cold start optimized**: Minimal dependencies and fast initialization
- **Memory efficient**: Low memory footprint ideal for serverless functions
- **Edge deployment ready**: Works seamlessly on Cloudflare Workers, Vercel Edge
- **Scalable**: Stateless design enables easy horizontal scaling

## Next Steps

## Learnings from Drizzle SQLite Integration (August 2025)

- **Modern driver selection**: @libsql/client is recommended for Node.js v23+ due to better compatibility and no native build issues.
- **Repository pattern**: Clean separation between API (Zod) and DB (Drizzle) schemas improves maintainability and type safety.
- **TypeScript strictness**: Hono's strict type inference may require explicit type assertions when bridging API and DB layers.
- **Health checks**: Integrate database connectivity into readiness/liveness endpoints for robust production deployments.
- **Zero-config deployment**: SQLite's file-based approach is ideal for containerized and stateless services.
- **Migration management**: drizzle-kit enables version-controlled schema evolution; distributed SQLite (Turso) may need custom migration handling.
- **Performance**: Compile-time query building and connection pooling provide excellent efficiency for microservices.

1. **Review the specific router documentation** for implementation details
2. **Check the `/examples/` folder** for complete working implementations
3. **Consider your deployment target** (traditional servers vs. edge/serverless)
4. **Evaluate team expertise** and learning curve preferences
5. **Test performance characteristics** with your expected load patterns
