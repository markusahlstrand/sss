## Common Dependencies

All router options share some common Node.js dependencies for Service Standard v1 compliance:

### Authentication

```json
{
  "jsonwebtoken": "^9.0.2"
}
```

### Observability

```json
{
  "@opentelemetry/api": "^1.6.0",
  "@opentelemetry/auto-instrumentations-node": "^0.39.4",
  "@opentelemetry/sdk-node": "^0.43.0"
}
```

### Events

```json
{
  "cloudevents": "^6.0.4"
}
```

## Implementation Requirements

Regardless of router choice, all implementations must include:

### 1. Required Endpoints

- `GET /` - Service info (`{"name": "service-name", "version": "1.0.0"}`)
- `GET /openapi.json` - OpenAPI specification
- `GET /healthz` - Liveness probe
- `GET /readyz` - Readiness probe

### 2. Authentication & Authorization

- Bearer token validation with JWT
- Scope-based authorization
- Proper error responses (401/403)

### 3. Error Handling

- RFC 7807 Problem+JSON format
- Required error types: `validation_error`, `unauthorized`, `forbidden`, `not_found`, `conflict`, `internal_error`
- Detailed validation error messages

### 4. Request/Response Format

- Content-Type: `application/json` only
- JSON Schema validation for all endpoints
- Pagination with `limit` + `offset` parameters

### 5. Events

- CloudEvents v1.0 JSON format
- AsyncAPI 2.0+ specification
- Structured event publishing

### 6. Observability

- Structured JSON logs with: `timestamp`, `level`, `service`, `trace_id`, `span_id`, `message`
- OpenTelemetry integration with W3C Trace Context
- Correlation between requests and logs

## Choosing the Right Router

### Choose **NestJS** if:

- Building enterprise applications with complex business logic
- Working with large teams that need consistent patterns
- Need comprehensive tooling and ecosystem support
- Familiar with Angular or similar decorator-based frameworks
- Prefer strongly opinionated architecture

### Choose **Fastify** if:

- Performance is a critical requirement (high traffic, low latency)
- Building microservices with resource constraints
- Need JSON Schema validation with minimal overhead
- Want plugin-based architecture for modularity
- Comfortable with less opinionated frameworks

### Choose **Hono + Zod** if:

- Deploying to edge computing platforms (Cloudflare Workers, Vercel Edge)
- Building serverless functions with strict cold start requirements
- Want maximum type safety with compile-time schema validation
- Prefer modern Web Standards APIs over Node.js-specific patterns
- Need minimal bundle size for edge/serverless environments

## Learnings from Recent Implementations

### Hono + Zod OpenAPI Success (August 2025) âœ…

The Hono + Zod OpenAPI implementation was successfully generated and is fully operational:

**Key Strengths:**

- **Excellent type safety**: Full TypeScript inference from Zod schemas to API handlers
- **Automatic OpenAPI generation**: Schemas directly generate accurate API documentation
- **Edge-ready performance**: Ultra-fast with minimal bundle size for serverless deployment
- **Modern development experience**: Schema-first development with excellent tooling
- **Service Standard v1 compliance**: All requirements met with clean, maintainable code

### Drizzle SQLite Integration (August 2025) âœ…

- **Modern driver selection**: @libsql/client is recommended for Node.js v23+ due to better compatibility and no native build issues.
- **Repository pattern**: Clean separation between API (Zod) and DB (Drizzle) schemas improves maintainability and type safety.
- **TypeScript strictness**: Hono's strict type inference may require explicit type assertions when bridging API and DB layers.
- **Health checks**: Integrate database connectivity into readiness/liveness endpoints for robust production deployments.
- **Zero-config deployment**: SQLite's file-based approach is ideal for containerized and stateless services.

### Cloudflare Workers + R2 Storage (September 2025) âœ…

**Complete edge deployment stack with enterprise-grade file storage:**

**Technical Achievements:**

- **D1 Database**: SQLite-compatible serverless database with global replication
- **R2 Storage**: S3-compatible object storage with zero egress fees for audio/media files
- **Edge Runtime**: Global distribution to 200+ locations with sub-millisecond cold starts
- **Repository Injection**: Clean dependency injection pattern for D1Database and R2Bucket bindings

**Key Implementation Patterns:**

- **Worker Entry Point**: `/// <reference types="@cloudflare/workers-types" />` and proper binding interfaces
- **Build Optimization**: Separate `tsconfig.worker.json` excluding Node.js-specific files
- **Package Dependencies**: Move `@types/*` to `devDependencies`, use `npx` in build commands
- **Multipart Uploads**: Native `formData()` parsing with R2 integration for real file uploads
- **Migration Strategy**: `wrangler d1 migrations apply` for both local and remote databases

**Performance Benefits:**

- **Global CDN**: R2 files served from edge locations worldwide
- **Cost Efficiency**: No egress fees for file downloads, pay-per-request pricing
- **Automatic Scaling**: Handle traffic spikes without configuration
- **Zero Maintenance**: Managed database and storage with enterprise SLAs

**Development Experience:**

- **Local Development**: `wrangler dev` provides seamless local development environment
- **Easy Deployment**: Single command deployment with automatic asset optimization
- **Monitoring**: Built-in analytics and real-time logs via Cloudflare dashboard
- **Version Management**: Automatic rollback capabilities and deployment history

**File Storage Architecture:**

- **Structured Keys**: `audio/{show_id}/{episode_id}/{file_id}/{filename}` organization
- **Public URLs**: `https://bucket-name.r2.dev/key` for immediate global access
- **Custom Domains**: Support for branded CDN domains (cdn.yourservice.com)
- **Metadata Tracking**: File info stored in D1 with relationships to business entities

1. **Review the specific router documentation** for implementation details
2. **Check the `/examples/` folder** for complete working implementations
3. **Consider your deployment target** (traditional servers vs. edge/serverless)
4. **Evaluate team expertise** and learning curve preferences
5. **Test performance characteristics** with your expected load patterns
